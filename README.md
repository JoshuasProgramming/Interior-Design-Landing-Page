# Ecommerce Website - Interior-Design-Landing-Page

I created a fully responsive ecommerce website from viewing a UX/UI design online. This website uses HTML, SASS & Responsive Design.

## Lessons Learned

I really enjoyed the process of breaking down the UX/UI design into small chunks, via divide and conquer.
The lessons learned are below:

* Re-creating a website as close as possible to the design that was given to me. 
* (updating my knowledge on) Responsive Design
* Adding favicon to a page 
* Creating a website ASAP

## Challenges
